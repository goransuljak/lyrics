// LYRICS APP WITH BRAD 

1.CREATE CONST apiURL = 'https://api.lyrics.ovh';
2.CREATE EVENTS FROM HTML (getElementById)
3.ADD EVENT LISTENERS ON SUBMIT
(e.preventDefault() so it doesnt submit to file)
const searchTerm = search.value.trim(); )
4.CREATE searchSong() function so we can search song
older way: 
(we use fetch example: fetch(`${apiURL}/suggest/${term}`).then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))

other way this same way simplier

async function ...
const res = await fetch(`${apiURL}/suggest/${term}`);
const data = await res.json();

5.WE CREATE SHOW DATA FUNCTION // show song and artist in DOM
6.CREATE VARIABLE OUTPUT AND SET TO NOTHING,
THEN LOOP TRUE EACH AND APPEND ON THE OUTPUT IN BACTICS
IT BE LIST ITEM OF <li></li> and <span></span>
inside template literate to update DOM.
under we will have button to get lyrics.

otuside function we can add result.innerHTML with <ul> and ${output}

other way we can do it with map directly say that to ul inside template literate
data.data.map for each song <li>, and were it ends just add .join('') to join items

7.SEE MORE PAGES AND CREATE NEXT AND PREVIOUS

so under result we do if else statement and turn it into HTML

8.THEN CREATE FUNCTION TO GET MORE SONGS
we async function and fetch url and show data get prev and next songs

9.CORS ERROR SHOWS UP SO WE CAN FIX IT WITH PROXY AND HEROKU  AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS ADD https//cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/${url}; inside of fetch

10.GET LYRICS BUTTON TO WORK WE NEED TO ADD EVENTLISTENER

result.addEventListener('click'..............
and if (clickedEl.tagName === "BUTTON") 

11.GET LYRICS FOR SONG WE AGAIN DO ASYNC FUNCTION TO GET LYRICS
SO WE FETCH AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WE DONT NEED CORS, AND WE WANT TO FETCH FROM 
apiURL the main we defined.

12.WE USE REGULAR EXPRESSION TO GET DATA.LYRICS.REPLACE(/()/||... ANYWAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS REGULAR EXPRESSION
AND IF FIND SOMETHING WE WANT TO HAVE LINE BREAK WITH <BR>

13.NOW WE INSERT IT IN DOM AND SET RESULT.INNERHTML H2 - ARTIST, SONG TITLE
SPAN inside will be lyrics
